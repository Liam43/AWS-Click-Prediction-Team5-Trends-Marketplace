# Xgboost Modeling Log



For experiencing the advantage of Amazon SageMaker, we built our predictive model with the steps guided on its platform. The following is the result of the model.



1. **Hyperparameter Setting**

**Conclusion:** Using only 2 basic features and sample data, the built-in Xgboost on Amazon SageMaker can train a model that has more than 70% AUC. There are Hyperparameter tuning jobs and other latest updated models provided on Amazon SageMaker platform, it will be a great source for us to use and explore for better machine learning model.
